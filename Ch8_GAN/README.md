### Exercise 1: Implement the DCGAN

- Implement the `train.py` of [this repo](https://github.com/tensorlayer/dcgan) from scratch.

### Exercise 2: Study and Explain W-GAN

- Change the DCGAN loss to W-GAN and see the result.

### Exercise 3: Choice an application and implement it (Optional)
You can propose a GAN application or choice one on below:

- [CycleGAN](https://github.com/luoxier/CycleGAN_Tensorlayer)
- [Attention CycleGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02311.pdf)
- [Text2Image](https://github.com/zsdonghao/text-to-image)
- [HoloGAN]
- [Style-based GAN]
